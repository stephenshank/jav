class ScrollBroadcaster {
  /* ScrollBroadcaster is a class used to coordinate the scrolling of multiple DOM elements.
   * It follows the publishâ€“subscribe pattern.
   * 
   * The following conventions/names are used:
   *  - DOM elements have a full width/height described in terms of pixels.
   *  - When only a part of a DOM element is shown/rendered that part is refered to as the viewport.
   *  - Scrolling can be thought of as moving the viewport around the DOM element.
   *  - The location of the viewport on the DOM element is described by the location of the top left corner of the viewport in two ways:
   *      1. pixel: How many pixels over/down from the top left corner of the complete DOM element.
   *      2. fraction: What fraction of the way across/down relative to the complete DOM element.
   *      (NOTE: because the top left corner of the viewport can never reach the bottom or right of the DOM element
   *             the "fraction" will never be 100%... two variables `upper_x_fraction` & `upper_y_fraction` are
   *             therefore used to describe the maximum fraction that the upper left corner can reach.
